Hello.
I'm Konstantinos. 
I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. These are some projects I developed to teach myself embedded systems and other stuff, because when in uni, apparently, I took all the wrong courses.
Cheers.


## Featured Projects

### SysTick Driver

A bare-metal STM32F401RE project demonstrating SysTick peripheral implementation for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. This educational project showcases direct hardware register manipulation without HAL drivers, focusing on learning the fundamentals of embedded systems timing.

*Key Features:*
- **Bare-Metal Programming** - Pure C implementation without HAL drivers
- **SysTick Peripheral** - Direct ARM Cortex-M4 SysTick register manipulation
- **Educational Focus** - Learn about ARM Cortex-M4 processor timing fundamentals
- **STM32F401RE Target** - Complete project structure with Core, Inc, and Startup files

- [Project Documentation](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver#readme)

### STM32 Debug Shell

An interactive command-line interface for the STM32F401RE microcontroller, providing real-time system monitoring and hardware control over UART. This project demonstrates advanced embedded systems programming with a full-featured terminal interface.

*Key Features:*
- **Interactive Terminal** - Full command-line interface over UART (115200 baud) with history navigation
- **Two-Tier Debugging** - High-level `status` commands for quick checks, low-level `showreg` for raw register dumps
- **System Monitoring** - Real-time clock frequencies, HAL version, device ID, and uptime
- **Hardware Control** - GPIO manipulation, LED control, and peripheral status monitoring
- **User-Friendly** - Command history, Ctrl+C interrupt, backspace support, and comprehensive help system
- **Register Inspection** - Direct register reading with hex and binary representation for deep debugging

## About Me

Iâ€™m a backend software engineer by day and an embedded systems enthusiast by night. My experience covers the entire software development lifecycle, from concept and design through implementation, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

More often than not, I find myself missing the interaction and impact that my day job has with things in the real world (yes, I am jealous of mechanical engineers). So for me, embedded systems is the ultimate intersection between the digital and physical worlds.
You still write code, of course, but the fact that it runs on â€” and often controls â€” something that exists in the real world is hugely intriguing to me.

**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space
