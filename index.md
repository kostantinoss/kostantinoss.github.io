Hello. I'm Konstantinos, I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. These are some projects I developed to teach myself embedded systems, because when in uni, I took all the wrong courses.
Cheers.


## Featured Projects

### SysTick Driver

A precise timing implementation using the SysTick peripheral for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. This project demonstrates direct hardware register manipulation and efficient delay functions.

**Key Features:**
- Precise millisecond and microsecond delay functions
- Direct hardware register access for optimal performance

**Project Links:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver)
- [Project Documentation](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver#readme)

### STM32 Debug Shell

Under development...

**Key Features:**
    TODO

**Project Links:**
- [GitHub Repository] ...
- [Project Documentation] ...



### More Projects Coming Soon

**Upcoming Projects:**
- IoT sensor data collection system
- Local network proxy (Go, Docker)
- Real-time operating system for ARM Cortex-M
- Custom bootloader implementation
- Self hosted local password manager (Go or Rust)



## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:**
- C
- Python (Advanced)
- Go (Familiar... haven't used it in quite a while but I'm eager to start learning again)
- Bash (Very familiar)

**Embedded Systems:**
- Bare-metal programming (STM32)
- Hardware abstraction layers (STM32 HAL)
- Interupt programming (Familiar)
- UART/I2C

**Development Tools:**
- STM32CubeIDE, CLion
- Git version control
- Cmake (familiar)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)


## About Me

Iâ€™m an embedded software enthusiast by night and a backend software developer during the day. My experience spans the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept and design to implementation, testing, and maintenance.

More often than not, I find myself missing the interaction and impact that my day job has with things in the real world (Yes, I am jealous of mechanical engineers). So for me, embedded is the ultimate intersection between the real world and software. Yes, you still write code, but I find the fact that the code lives and/or controls some item or object that lives in the real world hugely intriguing.


**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space
