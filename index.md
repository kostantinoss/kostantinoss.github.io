Hello.
I'm Konstantinos. 
I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. These are some projects I developed to teach myself embedded systems and other stuff, because when in uni, apparently, I took all the wrong courses.
Cheers.


## Featured Projects

### SysTick Driver

A precise timing implementation using the SysTick peripheral for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. This project demonstrates direct hardware register manipulation and efficient delay functions.

**Key Features:**
- Precise millisecond and microsecond delay functions
- Direct hardware register access for optimal performance

**Project Links:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver)
- [Project Documentation](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver#readme)

### STM32 Debug Shell

Under development...

**Key Features:**
    TODO

**Project Links:**
- [GitHub Repository] ...
- [Project Documentation] ...



### More Projects Coming Soon

**Upcoming Projects:**
- IoT sensor data collection system
- Local network proxy (Go, Docker)
- Real-time operating system for ARM Cortex-M
- Custom bootloader implementation
- Self hosted local password manager (Go or Rust)



## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:**
- C
- Python (Advanced)
- Go (Familiar... haven't used it in quite a while but I'm eager to start learning again)
- Bash (Very familiar)

**Embedded Systems:**
- Bare-metal programming (STM32)
- Hardware abstraction layers (STM32 HAL)
- Interupt programming (Familiar)
- UART/I2C

**Development Tools:**
- STM32CubeIDE, CLion
- Git version control
- Cmake (familiar)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)


## About Me

Iâ€™m a backend software engineer by day and an embedded systems enthusiast by night. My experience covers the entire software development lifecycle, from concept and design through implementation, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

More often than not, I find myself missing the interaction and impact that my day job has with things in the real world (yes, I am jealous of mechanical engineers). So for me, embedded systems is the ultimate intersection between the digital and physical worlds.
You still write code, of course, but the fact that it runs on â€” and often controls â€” something that exists in the real world is hugely intriguing to me.

**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space
