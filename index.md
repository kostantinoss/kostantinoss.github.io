Hello.
I'm Konstantinos. 
I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. These are some projects I developed to teach myself embedded systems and other stuff, because when in uni, apparently, I took all the wrong courses.
Cheers.


## Featured Projects

### STM32F401 Interactive Shell

A comprehensive debugging and monitoring shell for STM32F401 microcontrollers with UART interface, command history, and real-time peripheral monitoring. This advanced embedded systems project demonstrates sophisticated hardware interaction and debugging capabilities.

*Key Features:*
- **Interactive Terminal** - Full command-line interface over UART (115200 baud) with command history and arrow key navigation
- **System Information** - Real-time display of MCU specs, clock frequencies, and HAL version
- **Register Inspection** - Direct register dumps with hex and binary representation for GPIO, UART, and RCC peripherals
- **Hardware Control** - LED control (on/off/toggle) and GPIO state monitoring
- **Memory Efficient** - Only 2.1KB RAM usage (2.12% of 96KB) and 13KB Flash (2.48% of 512KB)
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of shell engine, UART driver, and GPIO driver components
- **Interrupt-Driven** - Non-blocking UART communication with automatic error recovery
- **Educational Focus** - Comprehensive documentation and build instructions for learning embedded systems

### SysTick Driver

A bare-metal STM32F401RE project demonstrating SysTick peripheral implementation for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. This educational project showcases direct hardware register manipulation without HAL drivers, focusing on learning the fundamentals of embedded systems timing.

*Key Features:*
- **Bare-Metal Programming** - Pure C implementation without HAL drivers
- **SysTick Peripheral** - Direct ARM Cortex-M4 SysTick register manipulation
- **Educational Focus** - Learn about ARM Cortex-M4 processor timing fundamentals
- **STM32F401RE Target** - Complete project structure with Core, Inc, and Startup files

## About Me

Iâ€™m a backend software engineer by day and an embedded systems enthusiast by night. My experience covers the entire software development lifecycle, from concept and design through implementation, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

More often than not, I find myself missing the interaction and impact that my day job has with things in the real world (yes, I am jealous of mechanical engineers). So for me, embedded systems is the ultimate intersection between the digital and physical worlds.
You still write code, of course, but the fact that it runs on â€” and often controls â€” something that exists in the real world is hugely intriguing to me.

**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space
