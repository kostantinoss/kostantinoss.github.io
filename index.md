Hello. I'm Konstantinos, I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. These are some projects I developed to teach myself embedded systems, because when in uni, I took all the wrong courses.
Cheers.

## Featured Projects

### SysTick Driver

A precise timing implementation using the SysTick peripheral for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. This project demonstrates direct hardware register manipulation and efficient delay functions.

**Key Features:**
- Precise millisecond and microsecond delay functions
- Direct hardware register access for optimal performance

**Project Links:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver)
- [Project Documentation](https://github.com/kostantinoss/SysTick_driver#readme)

## About Me

I'm an embedded software enthusiast by night, I write backend software during the day.
My experience spans the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept and design to implementation, testing, and maintenance.

More often than not I find myself missing the interaction and impact that may day job has with things in the real world (Yes I am jealus of mechanical engineers).
So for me, embedded is the ultimate intrection between real world and software. Yes, ok, you still write code, but I find hugely intriguing the fact that the code lives and/or controlls some item or object that lives in the real world.


**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space
