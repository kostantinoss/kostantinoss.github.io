title: About
---

I'm a backend software engineer by day and an embedded systems enthusiast by night. My experience covers the entire software development lifecycle, from concept and design through implementation, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

More often than not, I find myself missing the interaction and impact that my day job has with things in the real world (yes, I am jealous of mechanical engineers). So for me, embedded systems is the ultimate intersection between the digital and physical worlds.

You still write code, of course, but the fact that it runs on â€” and often controls â€” something that exists in the real world is hugely intriguing to me.

**What drives me:**
- Interesting problems in interesting fields (automotive, aerospace... etc.)
- That one day my code will fly in space

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:**
- C
- Python (Advanced)
- Go (Familiar... haven't used it in quite a while but I'm eager to start learning again)
- Bash (Very familiar)

**Embedded Systems:**
- Bare-metal programming (STM32)
- Hardware abstraction layers (STM32 HAL)
- Interrupt programming (Familiar)
- UART/I2C

**Development Tools:**
- STM32CubeIDE, CLion
- Git version control
- CMake (familiar)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
